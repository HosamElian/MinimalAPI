# ‚öôÔ∏è Building RESTful Services with .NET Minimal API

This repository demonstrates how to develop clean, efficient, and secure RESTful services using **.NET Minimal APIs**‚Äîa streamlined, expressive approach introduced by Microsoft for building APIs with minimal overhead. This project highlights essential backend development concepts using modern tools and practices in the .NET ecosystem.

## üìò Key Objectives

This project is designed to help developers:

- Understand the core principles of **.NET Minimal APIs**
- Develop and manage **HTTP endpoints** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Integrate **API documentation** for developer-friendly interaction (e.g., Swagger)
- Implement **Dependency Injection** with tools like `AutoMapper` and input validation
- Apply **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** and validation best practices
- Adopt the **Repository Pattern** for abstracting data access logic
- Use **Entity Framework Core** with **code-first migrations**
- Incorporate **Authentication and Authorization** using JWT
- Implement **custom filters and middleware** for error handling and cross-cutting concerns

## üß± Project Structure

- `Program.cs` ‚Äì Minimal API configuration and endpoint mapping  
- `Models/` ‚Äì Domain models and DTOs  
- `Repositories/` ‚Äì Repository pattern implementation for data access  
- `Data/` ‚Äì DbContext and EF Core migration files  
- `Mappings/` ‚Äì AutoMapper configuration profiles  
- `Filters/` ‚Äì Custom exception and validation filters  
- `Auth/` ‚Äì Authentication logic and JWT token handling

## üß∞ Technologies & Tools

- [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) with **Minimal API**
- **Entity Framework Core** (Code-First)
- **AutoMapper**
- **FluentValidation** or native model validation
- **JWT Bearer Authentication**
- **Swagger / OpenAPI** for API documentation
- **Dependency Injection** and **middleware pipeline**

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/minimal-api-demo.git
   cd minimal-api-demo
Apply migrations and set up the database

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet ef database update
Run the application

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet run
Access API documentation
Open your browser at http://localhost:5000/swagger

üí¨ Why Use Minimal API?
Minimal APIs offer a simplified and high-performance approach to building HTTP services in .NET, with benefits such as:

Reduced boilerplate and startup time

Easier to build and test for small to mid-sized APIs

Seamless integration with dependency injection, middleware, and routing

Ideal for microservices, serverless functions, and lightweight applications

üë§ Target Audience
This project is ideal for:

Developers looking to understand the Minimal API approach in .NET

Backend engineers seeking to build lightweight REST APIs

Engineers transitioning from traditional Web APIs to modern minimal patterns
